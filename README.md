This repository contains a flood vulnerability prediction model. To see the "Flood Vulnerability Level" (e.g. Highly Vulnerable, Moderately Vulnerable, Less Vulnerable) of any location based on its flood-related parameter (e.g.Rainfall, Elevation, Slope), follow these steps:

### Step 1: Launch the Notebook on Binder
- Click on the **Binder badge** to launch the notebook in an interactive environment:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/OmarFarukOvi70/Flood_Prediction/main)

### Step 2: Input Parameter's Value for Your Selected Location
Once the notebook opens, you will be prompted to enter values such as:
- **Rainfall (mm)**
- **Elevation (m)**
- **Slope (%)**
### Step 3: View the Prediction
Once youâ€™ve entered all the required data, the notebook will display the flood risk prediction based on your inputs.
